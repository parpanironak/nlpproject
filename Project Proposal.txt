The goal of our project is to make possible the efficient wikification of
arbitrary input documents: for each mention (word, name, term), we will attempt
to find the correct wikipedia entry and link to it. Our project will of course
address the problem of synonyms: in the case where a word has 2 or more possible
meanings, we will attempt to disambiguate between them and select the correct
one.
Disambiguating between meanings will be achieved through several techniques: we
intend to use context to differenciate between meanings. We will be choosing the
meaning that makes the most sense in the context we are working with. To
determine meanings, we will be working with the Ochiai coefficient at the level
of the whole document, the paragraph and the phrase itself. We will also be
trying to take into account the coherence of disambiguations across the entire
document. Finally, we will attempt to maximize the coherence between
disambiguated terms.
